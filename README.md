## Ikiru: Debug your life

### Overview

Ikiru is a self hosted app that acts like your life journal. Logs all the things that happened in your life! Make it easier to debug :wink. Because this is self-hosted, it is all yours! Want to make it public? Just deploy! You logged some controversial things? Make it anonym! The design is trash? Rewrite the frontend! It is all yours!
